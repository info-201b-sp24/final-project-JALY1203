These changes include many things like strategy, rules changes, players roles, advancements, and more. The main thing that I want to identify is what changes occurred and how they affected the current NBA. This question is the main motivation for the entire project and it aims to highlight the old and current trends in basketball in the NBA. As with any game, knowing how the game has changed is incredibly important and necessary for analyzing who the best teams/players really are. Some of the questions that I aim to answer in this project is how 3 point shooting has changed throughout the years? Have personal fouls gone up or down? And what teams were most dominant in their respective eras?"),

In the first chart, you can see how the ratio increased rather slowly at first from 1980 until 1995, where the NBA moved the 3 point line closer, causing a short jump in 3 point attempts until teams went back to their normal mid range game. From then on the ratio again was increasing quite slowly until about 2013 where 3 point shooting started becoming much more prevalent."),

However, some points on the graph corroborate some rule changes, like the peak in 2005-2006, when hand checking became illegal, or in 2002, where zone defense was legalized, making the game slower, and more lenient of personal fouls."),

In the 80s and 90s, the Lakers dominated with the highest number of wins, this definitely makes sense as the Lakers had some of the best players during this period with players like Shaq, Magic, James Worthy, and more. The Spurs topped the charts for most wins in the league from 2000-2019 despite having not won recently (I believe in Wembenyama). Popovich as coach in combination with players like Tim Duncan and later on, Kawhi Leonard were key in their success."),

The 3 point shooting bit was especially insightful because while I am still a relatively casual viewer that only started watching around 2 years ago, learning how the game was in the past era and how 3 point shooting actually changed the game into what it is today really helps increase my depth in knowledge of the game overall. In terms of broader implications, with how much 3 point shooting is done in modern basketball, who knows what could come next? I donâ€™t think that the league will attempt to restrict it, but rather might look towards a 4 point line to further encourage long range shooters. This has been in debate for a while, but nothing has happened yet.")
